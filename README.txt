a. Install the Plugin on your site from the Plugin Section on Wordpress (access from your Admin section). To do this, in your WP admin panel, navigate to: Plugins > Add New > Search plugins > Pubble live chat > Install..

Once installed, you will see a message:

“You need to configure Pubble Messenger to add live chat on your website. Please configure your Pubble Messenger Live Chat.

b. Create (or/Sign In to) your Admin account and App ID on Pubble.

If you are NEW to Pubble, use <a href='https://www.pubble.io/deploy' target="_blank" style='text-decoration:none;'>Let’s Deploy</a>. This option let’s you create your Pubble Team, Admin account and get your App ID. The last step outputs the APP ID. In the code snippet, copy the app ID (number): data-app-id=“<b>00000</b>”

If you already have a Pubble account, use: <a href='https://www.pubble.io/signin' target="_blank" style='text-decoration:none;'>Sign in on Pubble</a>. Once signed in, you need to access the Pubble Admin section. Click the “Admin” icon bottom left of the Dashboard or include “/admin” in the url (https://yourteam.pubble.io/admin). Then click Apps > Messenger. In the Deploy Code section, copy the app ID (number): data-app-id=“<b>00000</b>”

So now that you have your APP ID, you can configure Pubble Messenger Live Chat on your website.
